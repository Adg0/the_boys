# Claim incentive with COMPV

Protocols in decentralised finance (DeFi) often generate revenues by accruing fees across a range of markets in a variety of different asset types. The default behaviour of the protocol will typically be to hold all these asset types on the protocolâ€™s balance sheet as protocol-owned liquidity (POL). However, this will often be a suboptimal use of accrued fees.

## Dutch Auction

The mechanism involves a Dutch auction where the price starts high and decreases over time. The first person to pay the auction price at a certain point is allowed to claim all the assets in the treasury.
